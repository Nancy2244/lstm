# lstm
This is a repository with my first work on LSTM NNs that I used to analyse students log-files.
The test was devoted to critical thinking skills assessment. The data was gathered in December 2020 (uploaded in actions.csv file)
Currently, there are 2 files with code: 1_layer_LSTM and 2_layer_LSTM, which is self-explanatory.
